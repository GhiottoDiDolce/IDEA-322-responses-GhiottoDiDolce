<h3> WEEK 07 READING RESPONSE: "BEYOND SPECULATIVE DESIGN: PAST - PRESENT - FUTURES"</h3>

While Reading _**“Beyond Speculative Design: Past - Present - Futures,”**_ I found Sara Bozanic to be intriguing to read about.
She was considered a _“hybrid”_ within the reading for her ability to design, educate, think critically, and strategize for
the purpose of transmedia design. What resonated with me most about her participation developing digital design for the
_**“Voice of Culture Project,”**_ was the wide range of creativity and where to put her efforts. In the reading it states, 
_“She has been working for many years on the promotion of transmedia design disciplines in Europe, organizing events, 
designing labs, and lectures.”_ This sentence struck me because I am a person who likes to utilize my abilities on multiple
fronts involving not only artistic purposes, but revolutionary purposes. She is playing her part in evolving the age of digital
design. I hope to help the world evolve one step at a time, and I don’t want to limit myself to one purpose, but as many as I can!
