# INVENT A MUSEUM #

**Museum name:** Museum of Italian Masquerade

**Purpose:** 

My father has continued a tradition passed down through generations of his family, which is to collect vintage, historic, and antique Masquerade Masks.
Many of which date back to the “Age of the Carnival of Venice.” My father enjoys telling me the stories he knows that are connected to each specific mask.  


**Contents of museum:** 

I would create a gallery space with most of the room being dark.
I would hang the masks up along black walls at the average eye level, with glass separating the viewers to the masks.  
The only light shown is a liminal illusion where the lighting makes it seem as if the viewer is wearing the masks they are viewing. 

**Mission:** 

To spread awareness of Italian history which runs through my veins, and is very important to me.
Plus some of the masks’ stories involve my own family’s personal stories living in 18th-century Venice, Italy. 
Overall however, I hope to embrace celebration of not only history, but cultures, and art all together.

_A Carnival!_
