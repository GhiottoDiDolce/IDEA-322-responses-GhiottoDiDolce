<h3>WEEK 08 READING RESPONSE: SPECULATIVE DESIGN</h3>

Watching _**“Space Is The Place”**_ was such a joy, especially given Sun Ra’s charismatic and imaginative personality that made him such an impact for Afro-Futurism and therefore, speculative design. He had a Afro-Futuristic ability to encourage new ways of thinking, imagining, learning, and exploring, while engulfing the core of African American culture and its identity, influence, and meanings for the students of his course _**“The Black Man in the Cosmos.”**_ His course is a form of speculative design because he embraces science fiction ideas such as time and space travel, aliens, and other astronomical and/or spiritual themes that incorporate African American cultural elements within them. As a result, students in his course are able to achieve intellectual success through teachings of values, inner identity, along with movements the video explained to be the purpose for  _“reclamation of American American culture.”_ This new speculative design of learning not only what teaching new criteria is needed for academic success, but for personal success of developing new ways to learn information, to explore your own identity, and to understand your place in the world and around others, etc. 

The works included in _**“Beyond Green”**_ resemble science fiction by incorporating environmental values/sustainability themes within the key components of the process along with ideas such as how technology is and/or may impact our future, utilizing sustainable art for the purpose of imaging new environmentally green practices, and can be used to resemble science fiction storytelling with regards to humanity, the planet, and the new age of technology. I believe the most profound narrative I could see somewhat repeated within the reading is the use of environmental waste (_such as garbage_) meaning more for the purpose of taking a non-environmentally safe source, and presenting it to the viewer in order to either create beautiful art, send a message, or engulf the viewer with the artist’s own beliefs,values, and/or ideas within the works
